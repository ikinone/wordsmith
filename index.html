                    <p>Do you want to produce effective information booklets and leaflets, instruction manuals, fact sheets, newsletters, business plans?</p>
                    <p>For design and accounting work it's good business sense to employ specialists. But when it comes to getting things down in writing, you've got a computer – so, why pay someone?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>that the content needs rearranging to end up in logical order
                        </li>
                        <li>whether your vocabulary and writing style is right for your readers
                        </li>
                        <li>about any gender, class or cultural bias in your text
                        </li>
                        <li>whether the typeface and layout of the text make it easy or hard to read
                        </li>
                        <li>that some information crucial to understanding has been left out, or
                        </li>
                        <li>that you've typed 'now' instead of 'not' – such a tiny slip ... such potentially catastrophic consequences!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you've already drafted a text, I can approach it from the reader's perspective – very different from the way that you, the writer, view it. My job is to make your publication communicate your message clearly, checking that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>it's in the kind of English that's right for your readers</li>
                        <li>information is included that's needed for full understanding</li>
                        <li>the text follows a logical order</li>
                        <li>contents and referencing are used if required</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>and around 20 more editing/proofreading tasks that will maximise the effectiveness of your publication – ask me for the list.</p>
                    <p>Good writing enhances your image, so readers will be impressed; your publication will become a springboard to help create more and better business for you.</p>

                    <p>Are you drafting a <b>business text</b>, and want it checked over?</p>
                    <p>I'm a very experienced editor / proofreader, and have spent a sizeable chunk of my adult life in the commercial world. So I can achieve anything from a quick polish to a thorough makeover, depending on your needs. Scroll up to Text Management above.</p>
                    <p>Are you <b>writing a book</b>? If so, please scroll down to Editing below.</p>
                    <p>Are you <b>writing a thesis, dissertation or essay</b>?</p>
                    <p>Academic writing must be your own work. But what if your first language is not English? Or if you have acknowledged difficulty getting things down in writing?</p>
                    <p>If so, most universities and colleges allow you to have your text checked by an English proofreader. This helps ensure your meaning is clear and that the text is written in academic British English.</p>
                    <p>Cost? From £15 to £35 per 1,000 words. (For a more exact price, see 'What's the next step?' below.)</p>
                    <p>Time? I can normally proofread about 15,000 words in about two working days, and about 40,000 words in a working week and so on. But you'll need to check that I have space in my schedule. The more advance notice you give me, the more likely I can work for you when you need me.</p>
                    <p>Please also give yourself a few days after I've returned the completed text to you. You will need some time to check the changes I've made, before you submit your work for assessment and marking.<br></p>
                    <p><b>What's the next step? </b></p>
                    <p>Please email me, to:</p>
                    <p>1) tell me the title, subject and word limit of your text, </p>
                    <p>2) tell me your submission deadline, and </p>
                    <p>3) send me a 500-word sample of the text. </p>I will tell you whether I am competent to work on the subject matter and whether I can fit the work into my schedule. If both those conditions are met, I will work on your sample for free, and I will normally return it to you within 24 hours, with an exact price per 1,000 words.
                    <p>So before you go any further:</p>a) you will know that we can meet your deadline
                    <p></p>b) you can see what kind of work I would do for you, and
                    <p></p>c) you will know exactly how much the job will cost you.
                    <p></p>

She immediately answered our cry for help and couldn’t have been more helpful throughout our time of working with her. We found Caroline a fast, accurate and efficient editor.' (full text on the Testimonials page).</p>
                    <p>If you produce TEFL teacher-trainer books, you will find that my long experience in this field will help produce texts that are relevant and easy to understand.</p>
                    <p>I have also worked on educational texts – course books and teacher books – at primary and secondary levels, and am fully aware of the need to achieve coherence, cohesion – and correctness! – throughout.</p>
                    <p>Or perhaps you're a <b> writer – of fiction, memoirs, family history, local history </b> – who wants to ensure your work is as good as it can be before it goes to an agent, a publisher or the public. The many <b>self-publishing</b> writers I have worked with have – in some cases rather to their surprise – greatly enjoyed the process of checking their work before publishing. One of my recent authors said to her publisher: 'Caroline and I have had SUCH fun getting the m/s sorted! I must say, she has been absolutely wonderful to work with.' </p>
                    <p>I have been working as an editor since 1993. My services range from copy-editing to rewriting to structural editing and developmental editing (coordinating a project from first drafts, incorporating input from authors, consultants and editors, to produce a designer-ready text).</p>

                    <p>I am an <b>Advanced Professional Member</b> of the Society for Editors and Proofreaders – the highest possible grade – and I continue to update my training to keep abreast of the fast-moving world of IT and the subtle changes in language that reflect our developing culture. See my directory entry at http://www.sfep.org.uk/directory/caroline-petherick-wordsmith.</p>
                    <p>I have an Open University <b>degree in linguistics, Latin + Ancient Greek, and astronomy + cosmology</b>. My activities include crewing a Tall Ship, piloting my own microlight and converting a barn into an offgrid holiday cottage, so visitors can find out what fun – and how easy! – it can be to live sustainably (see www.windsworth.org.uk). So my knowledge base is eclectic, helping ensure that any text I work on for you will be well received by your readers.</p>

                    <p>'Caroline was a joy to work with on our projects. She immediately answered our cry for help and couldn’t have been more helpful throughout our time of working with her. We found Caroline a fast, accurate and efficient editor with a keen eye for attention to detail who could work to extremely tight deadlines, always delivering when she said she would. Caroline has meticulous editing and proofreading skills and is willing to learn and research the subject matter, checking facts and questioning material that needs clarity and providing suggestions based upon her expertise. All of her suggestions were well thought out and pertinent. We would have no hesitation in using Caroline for our future projects.'
                    <i>Barbara Jones, Curator of Maritime History and Education, Lloyd’s Register.</i></p>
                    <p>'We have been working with Caroline for several years and across a broad range of projects and subjects. It is a pleasure to work with her – she is efficient, accurate, knowledgeable, diplomatic and very understanding. She handles authors beautifully, with their own expectations and foibles, and we have received compliments from several who have praised her work, her understanding and the improvements she has brought to their manuscript. I have worked with editors for 40 years and I can say wholeheartedly and with objectivity that Caroline is one of the very best. I am constantly amazed by her knowledge and skills and appreciate her sense of humour – it all helps the editing flow more smoothly!' <br><i>Dr Keith Whittles, Whittles Publishing</i></p>
                    <p>'I just want to say a big thank you for all your help and expertise. Your knowledge of Word is clearly extensive and has broadened my horizons in that area but your efficiency, reliability and professional standards are exemplary.'<br><i>John Crozier, author</i></p>
                    <p>'Caroline, I totally trust your excellent work! Cheers, Herbert.' <br><i>Dr Herbert Puchta, Professor of English at the Teacher Training University in Austria </i></p>
					<p>'As I have discovered, writing a book doesn’t just happen. Not only do I have to endure the at times crippling process of love then hate of my own writing, but others have to read it too. Fortunately I’m blessed with a great team around me, and this has helped me improve every aspect of my work. I would particularly like to thank my editor Caroline Petherick (the-wordsmith.co.uk) for her support. People often ask me what an editor does and if they need one for their book. My answer is that to publish a book without an editor would be total madness. Caroline not only corrects my grammar and punctuation, but she proof reads my work and checks the consistency of facts – names, places, people, dates. It would be embarrassing to have to reveal how many errors she finds, but I don’t think I am alone amongst other authors. We all need a second pair of eyes.' <br><i>Matthew Woodward, author of </i>Trans-Siberian Adventures<i> and </i>A Bridge Even Further.</p>

                    My <b>business background</b> covers the UK and Hong Kong, including PR work for J Walter Thompson, and 10 years running a special interest travel company (classical music festivals, natural history, fine arts and architecture, and fine food and wine). And just so's there's no risk of you thinking I'm all work and no play, <b>I'm also involved in</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Car <b>driving </b>– I became a member of the IAM and I sometimes have fun in a skid pan, too. Drives etched on my memory include (1) nipping over the pass from La Paz down for lunch in the steamy heat of the rainforest in the mid-70s (along what I later learnt was the Camino de La Muerte) in a beat-up rented Beetle; and (2) penetrating the fastnesses<span class="st"> of the Zhongyang Range in ... a beat-up rented Beetle. What next? The Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility via the Karakoram Highway, and back again via Mt Kailas.</span></li>
                        <li>Scuba <b>diving </b>– I'm a PADI Open Water Diver and have dived the Channel, the Med and the Red Sea.</li>
                        <li><b>Winter sports</b> – I've spent winters abroad skiing in Switzerland and France, I've made a risible attempt at snowboarding, and I spent time in the Canadian Rockies on a snowmobile and helping train a dogsled team.</li>
                        <li><b>Aviation </b>– I hold a PPL, with IMC and Night Ratings. I have also flown a glider, a hang-glider and a helicopter, and have gone hot-air ballooning. I owned a Thruster microlight, but sold it when the adrenalin levels caused by its overstressed two-stroke engine went over the top. Next stop – when the price drops – a Calidus autogyro, to fly from home. Meanwhile it's a session or two at the Virtual Jet Centre in Devon. (Highly recommended as a present for any would-be pilot in your family.</li>
                        <li><b>Martial arts</b> – judo many years ago, then ki-aikido, and now the equally powerful, but less physically demanding, t'ai chi.</li>
                        <li><b>Sailing</b>, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>restoring and sailing a two-mast, gaff-rig traditional wooden boat</li>
                            <li>windsurfing – wobble'n'splash</li>
                            <li>yachting – Solent Points, Cowes Week and Kiel Week racing and cruising, DoT Yachtmaster, Short-range Radio Operator</li>
                            <li>Tall Ship – crewing the STA's Prince William in the Azores.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Opera </b>– for several years I went to the gods in Covent Garden once or twice a week. I've also been to many festival performances at Bayreuth, Salzburg, Glyndebourne etc.</li>
                        <li><b>More arts</b> – I'm the Discovery Days organiser for Liskeard Arts, my local Arts Society branch; and for several years I've been the projectionist for Cinema by the Sea.</li>
                        <li><b>Family</b> – I'm mum to four young adults who are now scattered across the globe, startling the locals no doubt. Feeling guilty about thus increasing the population, I've told them that if they really want to have children, then they'll need to be prepared for a thoroughly subversive granny person.</li>
                        <li><b>Weird</b> and wonderful – I enquire into healing and dowsing.</li>
                        <li><b>Travel</b> – I've travelled widely overland and by sea in Europe, Asia (inc. Trans-Siberian), Africa, and North and South America.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For nearly 10 years I ran an upmarket travel company (art and architecture, wildlife, gastronomy, classical music festivals), so I travelled extensively on business.</li>
                            <li>In addition, I've stayed long-term in these countries: Iceland, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Gozo, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal (inc Madeira and Azores); Pakistan, India, Nepal, USSR (inc Trans-Siberian), Hong Kong, Japan, Peru.</li>
                            <li>And I've travelled overland in: Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Andorra, Yugoslavia, Greece; Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Macao, China, Taiwan; Morocco, Egypt, Zimbabwe; Canada (inc Trans-Canadian), Colombia, Bolivia, and Venezuela.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Languages </b>– I had excellent French, Italian and German, and I still have a conversational knowledge of those languages, plus 'get-by' knowledge of the languages of many of the countries I've visited.</li>
                        <li>Back at home? I'm lucky enough to live on a half-mile tranche of Cornish coast – and I've earned <b>DEFRA's HLS award</b>. This helps me maximise biodiversity, thus leave this small but perfectly formed part of the world in better heart than I found it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>There are reasons why I've listed all these things – first of all I'm quite proud of them, and second if your text has anything to do with any of them, you can expect an extra good result.</p>
